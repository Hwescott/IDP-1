Reflection
=============

This was my first IDP of the year. I wanted to learn how to use the map function order to have the colors change based on where they are on the screan, so that is what I taught myself. So, I worked with the map object in order to have the little circles change their color. I also wanted to have the move using a fuction, I worked with degree and vectors in order to broaden my coding knowledge on those objects so that I could hopefully use them in future projects.
