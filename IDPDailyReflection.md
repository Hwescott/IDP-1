# IDP Daily Reflection

- Day one: I planned out what I wanted to do. I wanted to make some sort of drawing with lots of colors and movement. I began to code different ideas that I had, until I came up with the moving circles that move around a circle.

- The next time I worked on the project, I began playing around with the size of each point where they would move, how many there would be and how spaced they would be. I played around with the density and space until I got what I wanted.

- The next day I began working with map to change the colors of the points based on their location. I had a few problems with this until I finally worked it out for them to be different colors.

-  I ended with trying to add a circle where that is the only place where it can be seen, but I never finished that portion of the project mostly because I didnâ€™t like how it looked.
